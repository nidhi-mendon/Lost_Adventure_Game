    "\n",
    "Lost is an American science fiction drama television series that contains elements of supernatural fiction, and follows the survivors of a commercial jet airliner flying between Sydney and Los Angeles after the plane crashes on a mysterious island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. The show begins with the aftermath of a plane crash, which leaves the surviving passengers of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 on what seems to be an uninhabited tropical island. Their survival is threatened by a number of mysterious entities, including polar bears, an unseen creature that roams the jungle (the \"Smoke Monster\"), and the island's malevolent inhabitants known as \"The Others\"."
